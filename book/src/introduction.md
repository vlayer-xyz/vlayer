# Introduction

vlayer provides tools and infrastructure that give smart contracts super powers like [time travel](/features/time-travel.html) to past blocks, [teleport](/features/teleport.html) to different chains, and access to real data from the [web](/features/web.html) and [email](/features/email.html).

vlayer allows smart contracts to be executed [off-chain](/advanced/proving.html). The result of the execution can then be used by [on-chain contracts](/advanced/verifier.html).

### Sections
**Getting Started**

To get started with vlayer, [install vlayer]((/getting-started/installation.md)), set up your [first project](/getting-started/first-steps.html) and check out the explainer section to learn [how vlayer works]((/getting-started/how-it-works.html)).

**Features**

See how to [time travel](/features/time-travel.html) across block numbers, [teleport](/features/teleport.html) from one chain to another, prove data coming from [email](/features/email.html) or [web](/features/web.html).

**Advanced**

Learn how [Prover](/advanced/prover.html) and [Verifier](/advanced/verifier.html) contracts are working in-depth.

**Contributing**

Help us improve [vlayer](/contributing/vlayer.md) and [vlayer book](/contributing/book.md)!
