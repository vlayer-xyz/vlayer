# Introduction

vlayer gives smart contracts superpowers like [time travel](/features/time-travel.html) to past blocks, [teleport](/features/teleport.html) to different chains and access real data from web and email.

vlayer smart contracts are [executed off-chain](/getting-started/how-it-works.html) and their results can then be used in on-chain transactions.
