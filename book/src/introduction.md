# Introduction

vlayer gives smart contracts superpowers like time travel to past blocks, teleport to different chains and access real data from web and email.

vlayer smart contracts are [executed off-chain](/getting-started/first-steps.html#off-chain-execution) and their results can then be used in on-chain transactions.
