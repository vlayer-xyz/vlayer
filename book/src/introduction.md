# Introduction

vlayer provides tools and infrastructure that give smart contracts super powers like [time travel](/features/time-travel.html) to past blocks, [teleport](/features/teleport.html) to different chains, access to real data from the [web](/features/web.html), and [email](/features/email.html).

vlayer allows smart contracts to be executed [off-chain](/advanced/prover.html). The result of the execution can then be used by [on-chain contracts](/advanced/verifier.html).

### Sections
**Getting Started**

To get started with vlayer, [install vlayer](/getting-started/installation.html), set up your [first project](/getting-started/first-steps.html) and check out the explainer section to learn [how vlayer works](/getting-started/how-it-works.html). Finally take a look into [devnet & testnet](/getting-started/dev-and-production.html) to learn about vlayer environments. 

**Features**

See how to [time travel](/features/time-travel.html) across block numbers, [teleport](/features/teleport.html) from one chain to another, prove data coming from [email](/features/email.html) or [web](/features/web.html) and use helpers for [JSON and Regex](/features/json-and-regex.html).

**From JavaScript**

Learn how to [interact with vlayer](/javascript/javascript.html) from your JS code and how to [generate web proofs](/javascript/web-proofs.html) and [email proofs](/javascript/email-proofs.html) using our SDK.

**Advanced**

Learn in-depth how:
 * [Prover](/advanced/prover.html) and [Verifier](/advanced/verifier.html) contracts are working.
 * [Global Variables](./advanced/prover-global-variables.md) are set.
 * [Tests](/advanced/tests.html) are run.
