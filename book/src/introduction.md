# Introduction

vlayer gives smart contracts superpowers, such as [time travel](/features/time-travel.html) to past blocks, [teleport](/features/teleport.html) to different chains and access real data from web and email.

vlayer allows to execute smart contracts [off-chain](/getting-started/first-steps.html#off-chain-execution). The result of the execution can be then used by on-chain contracts.
