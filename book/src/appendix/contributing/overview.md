## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and considerate in all interactions.
- Provide constructive feedback and avoid personal attacks.
- Assume good intent and work collaboratively.
- Avoid discriminatory language or behavior.

Let's build something great together!

## Getting Started
- Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making a Contribution
We welcome:
- Bug fixes
- Feature implementations
- Performance improvements
- Tests and refactoring
- Documentation updates

**Pro tip**: Before starting major changes, open an issue or draft PR to discuss with maintainers.

## Code Style and Linting
- Keep PRs focused and well-documented. 
- Ensure your code passes the lint checks and tests.
- Keep conversations focused, useful, inclusive, and respectful.  

## Pull Request Process
1. Before starting work on an issue, please check for existing work to ensure that it is not already being addressed by someone else. 
2. If you find an issue you would like to work on, add a comment to it expressing your interest, and a member of the vlayer team will reach out to you for a brief discussion.
3. Following the discussion, the vlayer team will formally assign the issue to you, indicating that you are the main contributor working on that particular issue.
4. Upon resolving the issue, please submit a Pull Request (PR) with your solution, ensuring that: 
   - Your PR targets the main branch.
   - Your branch is named clearly: `fix/bug-description`, `feature/feature-name`, etc.
   - Your PR includes a clear description i.e. What changes were made? Why are they necessary? Any open questions or assumptions. 
   - Link related issues using issue labels. 
5. Next, submit your PR and wait for a member of the vlayer team to review. The review process includes checking that the solution passes all necessary tests and effectively resolves the issue. If your contribution meets this criteria, we will merge it into the project.
6. Throughout the process, be responsive to feedback and open to suggestions
