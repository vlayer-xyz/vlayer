# Block proof cache

## Block inclusion proofs primer

### Storage proofs
A storage proof proves that a piece of chain state (account or smart contract variable) belongs to a certain block. To ensure that a piece of state belongs to a certain chain, it is not enough to prove that it belongs to a block. We must also prove that the block itself belongs to a chain.

### Recent and historical blocks
One way to prove that a block of a certain hash belongs to a chain is to run the Solidity `blockhash(uint)` function. It returns the hash of a block for a given number.
To perform a check, we need to hash a block with a certain state root and compare it with the result of the function.

However, this method is limited, as it only works for most recent 256 blocks on a given chain.
Therefore, we need another way to prove inclusion of older blocks in a chain. 

We use the following naming in this document:
- *recent blocks* - any of the most recent 256 blocks (relative to current block_no)
- *historical blocks* - blocks older than 256

### Naive block inclusion proofs
To prove inclusion of certain *historical blocks* in a chain, we will prove that:
1. Some *recent block* belong to a chain
2. Both *historical block* and *recent block* belong to the same chain

A naive way to prove the inclusion proof of two blocks in the same chain is to hash all subsequent blocks from *historical block* to *recent block* and verify that each blockhash is equal to the *prevHash* value of the subsequent block.

Unfortunately, this is a slow process, especially if the blocks are far away form each other on the time scale. Fortunately, there is a way to cache all proofs in advance. For this purpose, vlayer uses the Block Proof Cache.
