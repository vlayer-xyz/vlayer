# Redaction

The TLSN protocol allows for redacting (hiding) parts of the HTTPS transcript from the `Prover`—i.e., excluding certain sensitive parts (e.g., cookies, authorization headers, API tokens) from the generated Web Proof—while still cryptographically proving that the rest of the transcript (the revealed parts) is valid.

Different redaction modes have important security implications you should understand. Learn more in the [Security model](#security-model) section.

To learn how to enable and configure redaction using the vlayer SDK, see the [Redaction](../../javascript/web-proofs.md#redaction) section in our JavaScript documentation.

## Partial redaction

Each value must be either fully redacted or not redacted at all. The Solidity methods `webProof.verify(Url)` and `webProof.verifyWithUrlPrefix(UrlPrefix)` validate that these conditions are met. This ensures that the structure of the transcript cannot be altered by a malicious client.

After redacting a JSON string value for a given `"key"`, `web.jsonGetString("key")` returns a string in which each byte is replaced by the `*` character.

## Security model

The limitation of the current redaction process is that it does not incorporate HTTP semantics.

Redaction in TLSN works at the level of byte ranges.  
For example:

```js
redact(2, 4)
```

In an ideal world, redaction would understand the structure of HTTP requests/responses and offer a semantic API, such as:

- `redactRequestHeader("User-Agent")`
- `redactResponseJSONBodyField("sender.uuid")`

However, because TLSN uses byte-based redaction, it's possible to break tokens across boundaries.

For example, a URL like:

```
/user?name=John&surname=Smith
```

could be redacted as:

```
/user?name=Jo*****rname=Smith
```

Although such partial redactions are rejected by vlayer, there are edge cases we can't detect because the original values are hidden, and the redacted version appears valid. For instance:

```
/user?name=******************
```

is indistinguishable from a valid redaction.

### Implications

This means an attacker can:

- Remove query parameters
- Remove JSON fields
- Change JSON structure so that a field value appears under a different key
  - Fields can be moved both up and down the tree

#### Example: JSON body manipulation

Original JSON:

```json
{
    "outer": "",
    "nested": {
        "first": "malicious_value"
    },
    "first": "real_value",
    "second": ""
}
```

Redacted JSON (illustrative):

```json
{
    "outer": "** 
************* 
********first: "malicious_value" 
****** 
************************ 
    "second": ""
}
```

If the Prover later queries `.first`, it will return `malicious_value`.

## How to mitigate risks

### Request headers, body, and response headers

We do **not** expose these on the Web object, so even if they are parsed incorrectly, the Prover cannot access them.

---

### Request URL

- **If you can avoid redacting the URL**:  
  Set `UrlTestMode` to `Full` and use:

  ```js
  verify(Url)
  ```

- **If you must redact the URL**:  
  Set `UrlTestMode` to `Prefix` and use:

  ```js
  verifyWithUrlPrefix(UrlPrefix)
  ```

  You must treat all characters after the first redaction character as untrusted, since they can be manipulated.

---

### Response JSON body

- **If you can avoid redaction**:  
  Set:

  ```js
  BodyRedactionMode = "Disabled"
  ```

  This allows TLSN to verify that the body is valid, well-formed JSON.

- **If you must redact JSON body**:  
  Set:

  ```js
  BodyRedactionMode = "Enabled_UNSAFE"
  ```

  “UNSAFE” has a Rust-like meaning: **you** are responsible for ensuring safety. You **must** check:

  - All fields in your JSON schema are required (no optional fields)
  - Arrays have fixed, known-in-advance sizes (to avoid `[1, 2, 3]` ⇒ `[1, ****]`)
  - All required fields are present

These rules help prevent structural manipulation attacks, such as injecting or hiding malicious fields.

Use this mode **only as a last resort**, as it’s hard to apply safely in real-world production data.
