# Getting started

# Architecture

Vlayer allows you to run EVM smart contracts off-chain and use results of their execution on-chain. Off-chain smart contracts have extra capabilities, like access to historical state of many chains, user emails and web data.

## Off-chain smart contracts

By convention off-chain smart contracts have the `.v.sol` extension.

## Examples

You can find and run examples from `examples` directory.

To run an example - go to specific example directory (e.g. `examples/simple`) and run:

```sh
../../bash/vlayer-build.sh
```
