## Primer on blocks
The block number is a unique identifier assigned to each block in the Ethereum blockchain, starting from 0 for the genesis block and incrementing by one for each subsequent block. Smart contracts utilize block numbers to schedule events such as token releases, voting periods, and the start or end of auctions. By knowing the average block time, developers can estimate when these events will occur.

## Access to historical data 
Unfortunately, direct access to historical state from within smart contracts is impossible. This restriction means that smart contracts cannot easily reference past accounts and smart contracts data for decision-making or verification purposes.

To overcome the limitation of accessing historical blocks within smart contracts, we have introduced the `setBlockNumber(uint blockNo)` function, available in our `Prover` contracts. This function allows you to switch your next function call context to the desired block number.

This allows you to aggregate and review data collected over multiple block numbers. 

## Example
The following is an example of Prover code that calculates the average USDC balance at specific block numbers.

```solidity
contract AverageBalance is Prover {
    IERC20 immutable token;
    uint256 immutable startingBlock;
    uint256 immutable endingBlock;
    uint256 immutable step;

    constructor(IERC20 _token, uint256 _startBlockNo, uint256 _endingBlockNo, uint256 _step) {
        token = _token;
        startingBlock = _startBlockNo;
        endingBlock = _endingBlockNo;
        step = _step;
    }

    function averageBalanceOf(address _owner) public returns (address, uint256) {
        uint256 total = 0;
        uint256 iterations = 0;

        for (uint256 blockNo = startingBlock; blockNo <= endingBlock; blockNo += step) {
            setBlock(blockNo);
            total += token.balanceOf(_owner); // USDC balance in historic block
            iterations += 1;
        }
        uint256 average = total / iterations;

        return (_owner, average);
    }
}
```

First, the call to the `setBlock(blockNo)` function sets the `Prover` context for the `6600000` block (`startingBlock` configured in the constructor). This means that the next call to the `token.balanceOf` function will read data in the context of the `6600000` block.

Next call to `setBlock()` sets the `Prover` context to block numbered `6610000` when step is configured to `10000`. The next call to `token.balanceOf` checks again total balance, but this time in block `6610000`.

Each call to `token.balanceOf` can return different results if the account balance changes between blocks due to token transfers.

The for loop manages the balance checks, and the functionâ€™s final output is the average balance across multiple blocks.
