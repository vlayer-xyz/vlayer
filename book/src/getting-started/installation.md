# Installation

Simplest way to install vlayer is to use vlayerup, the vlayer toolchain installer.

To install vlayerup, run the following command in your terminal, then follow the onscreen instructions.
```sh
curl -SL  https://install.vlayer.xyz/install | bash
```

This will install `vlayerup` and make it available in your CLI.

Running `vlayerup` will install the latest (nightly) precompiled binary of vlayer:
```sh
vlayerup
```

See `vlayerup --help` for more options, like installing from a specific version or commit.
