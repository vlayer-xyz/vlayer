# First Steps

## Initialization

To initialize a vlayer project run following command inside your [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) project:
```bash
$ vlayer init
```

The command above will add all necessary dependencies and sample vlayer contracts.

## Testing

To run tests, one must first launch a local Ethereum node:
```bash
$ anvil 
```
and in a new terminal session:

```bash
$ vlayer serve
```
