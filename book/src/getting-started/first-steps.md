# First Steps

## Initialisation

To initialise a vlayer project run:
```bash
$ vlayer init
```
which should be run inside a foundry-based project.

The command above will add all necessary dependencies and sample vlayer contracts.

## Testing

To run tests, one must first run:
```bash
$ anvil 
```
and in a new terminal session:

```bash
$ vlayer serve
```
