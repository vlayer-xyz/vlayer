## Web Proofs

On top of access to vlayer JSON-RPC proving API, [vlayer client](./javascript.md) provides functionality to generate and prove [Web Proofs](../features/web.md).

### vlayer browser extension

![vlayer browser extension screenshot](/images/vlayer-browser-extension.png)

vlayer provides a [browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vlayer/jbchhcgphfokabmfacnkafoeeeppjmpl) which can be launched (once installed in user's browser) from vlayer SDK and used to generate a Web Proof of a 3rd party website.  
vlayer extension is compatible with Chrome and Brave browsers.

We start by instantiating vlayer client.

```ts
import { createVlayerClient } from '@vlayer/sdk'

const vlayer = createVlayerClient()
```

Next, we can define how the vlayer extension should generate the Web Proof. We do this in a declarative way, by specifying the steps the extension should guide the user through.

```ts
import {
  createWebProofRequest,
  startPage,
  expectUrl,
  notarize,
} from '@vlayer/sdk/web_proof'

const webProofRequest = createWebProofRequest({
  logoUrl: 'http://twitterswap.com/logo.png',
  steps: [
    startPage('https://x.com/i/flow/login', 'Go to x.com login page'),
    expectUrl('https://x.com/home', 'Log in'),
    notarize('https://api.x.com/1.1/account/settings.json', 'GET', 'Generate Proof of Twitter profile'),
  ],
})
```

The above snippet defines a Web Proof, which is generated by the following `steps`:
1. `startPage` - redirects the user's browser to `https://x.com/i/flow/login`.
2. `expectUrl` - ensures that the user is logged in and visiting `https://x.com/home` URL. The argument passed here is a [URL Pattern](https://urlpattern.spec.whatwg.org/) against which the user browser URL is checked.
3. `notarize` - prompts the user to generate a Web Proof, i.e. to notarize an HTTP `GET` request sent to `https://api.x.com/1.1/account/settings.json` URL. This step works by first capturing the request made by the user's browser to the given URL (which is a [URL Pattern](https://urlpattern.spec.whatwg.org/) against which browser request URLs are matched) and, once captured, the request is sent again, this time notarized.

Each step also accepts a human-readable message which the user will see. We can also optionally pass a link to custom logo to display in the extension.

Once we have a definition of how a Web Proof should be generated we can request it.

```ts
import { proverAbi } from './proverAbi'
import { sepolia } from 'viem/chains'

const hash = await vlayer.proveWeb({
    address: '0x70997970c51812dc3a010c7d01b50e0d17dc79c8',
    proverAbi,
    functionName: 'main',
    args: [webProofRequest, '0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045'],
    chainId: sepolia,
})
```

The above snippet:
* Opens vlayer browser extension and guides the user through the steps defined above. The Web Proof is generated using vlayer default *Notary* server and WebSocket proxy (see section [WebSocket proxy](#role-of-websocket-proxy) below for more details).
* Once the Web Proof is successfully generated, it is submitted to prover contract:
  * with address `0x70997970c51812dc3a010c7d01b50e0d17dc79c8`,
  * whose interface is defined by `proverAbi`,
  * calling `functionName` function of the contract,
  * passing the specified `args` - the generated Web Proof will be passed as first argument in this example,
  * executing the method call on prover contract within the context of `chainId`.

To learn more details about the Web Proof feature, please see the [Web Proof section](../features/web.md).

### Low-level API

While the vlayer client method `proveWeb` described above provides a convenient interface to both the vlayer browser extension and the prover contract, we also provide methods that can access each of them separately.

We can configure a Web Proof provider which uses vlayer browser extension and enables configuring custom [*Notary*](/features/web.html#notary) server and custom WebSocket proxy (see section [WebSocket proxy](#role-of-websocket-proxy) below for more details). 

```ts
import { createExtensionWebProofProvider } from '@vlayer/sdk/web_proof'

const webProofProvider = createExtensionWebProofProvider({
    notaryUrl: 'https://...',
    wsProxyUrl: 'wss://...',
})
```

Both `notaryUrl` and `wsProxyUrl` have default values:  
- **`notaryUrl`**: `https://test-notary.vlayer.xyz`  
- **`wsProxyUrl`**: `wss://test-wsproxy.vlayer.xyz`  

Because of these defaults, the provider can be initialized without any additional configuration as follows:

```ts
const webProofProvider = createExtensionWebProofProvider();
```

vlayer hosts a public instance of the [TLSN notary server](https://docs.tlsnotary.org/developers/notary_server.html) for development, experimentation, and demonstration purposes. Notary server can be also self-hosted using [Docker](https://docs.tlsnotary.org/developers/notary_server.html#using-docker).

In the future, vlayer is planning to provide additional Web Proof provider implementations, which can be e.g. ran server-side and don't require vlayer browser extension for the purpose of Web Proof generation.

The Web Proof provider exposes a low-level API to directly define `proverCallCommitment` (commitment to use the generated Web Proof only with the specified prover contract call details, so it's not possible to submit it in a different context) and to explicitly generate the Web Proof by calling `getWebProof`.

```ts
import {
  startPage,
  expectUrl,
  notarize,
} from '@vlayer/sdk/web_proof'

// all args required by prover contract function except webProof itself
const commitmentArgs = ['0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045']

const proverCallCommitment = {
  address: '0x70997970c51812dc3a010c7d01b50e0d17dc79c8',
  functionName: 'main',
  commitmentArgs,
  chainId: sepolia,
  proverAbi,
}

const webProof = await webProofProvider.getWebProof({
  proverCallCommitment,
  logoUrl: 'http://twitterswap.com/logo.png',
  steps: [
    startPage('https://x.com/i/flow/login', 'Go to x.com login page'),
    expectUrl('https://x.com/home', 'Log in'),
    notarize('https://api.x.com/1.1/account/settings.json', 'GET', 'Generate Proof of Twitter profile'),
  ],
})
```

Once we have the Web Proof available we can directly call vlayer client `prove` method, adding the Web Proof to previously created `proverCallCommitment`.

```ts
import { sepolia } from 'viem/chains'
import { proverAbi } from './proverAbi'

const proof = { webProofJson: JSON.stringify({ presentationJson: webProof.presentationJson }) };

const hash = await vlayer.prove({
    ...proverCallCommitment,
    args: [proof, ...commitmentArgs],
})
```

### Redaction

vlayer browser extension supports redaction, i.e. hiding certain parts of the HTTPS transcript in the generated Web Proof (see section [Redaction](../features/web.md#redaction) for protocol details). In order to configure how the extension redacts the transcript, we can pass the following additional configuration to `notarize` step:

```ts
  notarize(
    'https://api.x.com/1.1/account/settings.json', 
    'GET', 
    'Generate Proof of Twitter profile',
    [
      {
        request: {
          headers: ["cookie"],
        },
      }, {
        request: {
          url_query_except: [],
        },
      }, {
        response: {
          json_body_except: ["screen_name"],
        },
      }, {
        response: {
          headers: ["x-example-header"],
        },
      },
    ],
  )
```

In the above snippet, the last argument to `notarize` is a list of items, where a single item defines a single part of HTTP request/response that can be redacted. Each item comes in two flavours - the basic one which defines the items that will be redacted and the `*_except` one, which defines the items that *will not* be redacted. For example, `request: { headers: ["cookie"] }` will redact a single request header with name `cookie` and `request: { headers_except: ["cookie"] }` will redact all the other headers *except* `cookie` (we could pass an empty array `request: { headers_except: [] }` to redact all request headers).

By default, the transcript is not redacted at all and redaction of each HTTP request/response part needs to be configured to enable redaction.

### WebSocket proxy

The WebSocket proxy is required in the Web Proofs setup to allow the vlayer extension to access the low-level TLS connection of the HTTPS request for which we are generating a Web Proof (browsers do not provide this access by default). The default WebSocket proxy, `wss://test-wsproxy.vlayer.xyz`, used in our SDK and hosted by vlayer, supports a limited number of domains.

Currently, the allowed domains are:

- `x.com` and `api.x.com`
- `swapi.dev`

If you'd like to notarize a request for a different domain, you can run your own proxy server. To do this locally run websockify using Docker:

```bash
docker run -p 3003:80 jwnmulder/websockify 80 api.x.com:443
```

Replace `api.x.com` with the domain you'd like to use. Then, configure your Web Proof provider to use your local WebSocket proxy (running on port 3003):

```ts
import { createExtensionWebProofProvider } from '@vlayer/sdk/web_proof'

const webProofProvider = createExtensionWebProofProvider({
  wsProxyUrl: "ws://localhost:3003",
})
```

Now the notarized HTTPS request will be routed through your local proxy server.
