## Web Proofs

On top of access to vlayer JSON-RPC proving API, [vlayer client](./javascript.md) provides functionality to generate and prove [Web Proofs](../features/web.md).

### vlayer browser extension

![vlayer browser extension screenshot](/images/vlayer-browser-extension.jpg)

vlayer provides a [browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vlayer/jbchhcgphfokabmfacnkafoeeeppjmpl) which can be launched (once installed in user's browser) from vlayer SDK and used to generate a Web Proof of a 3rd party website.  
vlayer extension is compatible with Chrome and Brave browsers.

We start by instantiating vlayer client.

```ts
import { createVlayerClient } from '@vlayer/sdk'

const vlayer = createVlayerClient()
```

We can configure a Web Proof provider which uses vlayer browser extension and enables configuring custom [*Notary*](/features/web.html#notary) server and custom WebSocket proxy (see section [WebSocket proxy](#role-of-websocket-proxy) below for more details). 

```ts
import { createExtensionWebProofProvider } from '@vlayer/sdk/web_proof'

const webProofProvider = createExtensionWebProofProvider({
    notaryUrl: 'https://...',
    wsProxyUrl: 'wss://...',
})
```

Both `notaryUrl` and `wsProxyUrl` have default values:  
- **`notaryUrl`**: `https://notary.pse.dev/v0.1.0-alpha.5/`  
- **`wsProxyUrl`**: `wss://notary.pse.dev/proxy`  

Because of these defaults, the provider can be initialized without any additional configuration as follows:

```ts
const webProofProvider = createExtensionWebProofProvider();
```

TLSNotary team hosts a [public notary server](https://docs.tlsnotary.org/developers/notary_server.html#pse-development-notary-server) for development, experimentation, and demonstration purposes. Notary server can be also self-hosted using [Docker](https://docs.tlsnotary.org/developers/notary_server.html#using-docker)

In the future, vlayer is planning to provide additional Web Proof provider implementations, which can be e.g. ran server-side and don't require vlayer browser extension for the purpose of Web Proof generation.

The Web Proof provider exposes a low-level API to directly define `proverCallCommitment` (commitment to use the generated Web Proof only with the specified prover contract call details, so it's not possible to submit it in a different context) and to explicitly generate the Web Proof by calling `getWebProof`.

```ts
import {
  startPage,
  expectUrl,
  notarize,
} from '@vlayer/sdk/web_proof'

// all args required by prover contract function except webProof itself
const commitmentArgs = ['0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045']

const proverCallCommitment = {
  address: '0x70997970c51812dc3a010c7d01b50e0d17dc79c8',
  functionName: 'main',
  commitmentArgs,
  chainId: sepolia,
  proverAbi,
}

const webProof = await webProofProvider.getWebProof({
  proverCallCommitment,
  logoUrl: 'http://twitterswap.com/logo.png',
  steps: [
    startPage('https://x.com/i/flow/login', 'Go to x.com login page'),
    expectUrl('https://x.com/home', 'Log in'),
    notarize('https://api.x.com/1.1/account/settings.json', 'GET', 'Generate Proof of Twitter profile'),
  ],
})
```

The above snippet defines a Web Proof, which is generated by the following `steps`:
1. `startPage` - redirects the user's browser to `https://x.com/i/flow/login`.
2. `expectUrl` - ensures that the user is logged in and visiting `https://x.com/home` URL.
3. `notarize` - prompts the user to generate a Web Proof, i.e. to notarize an HTTP `GET` request sent to `https://api.x.com/1.1/account/settings.json` URL.

Each step also accepts a human-readable message which the user will see. We can also optionally pass a link to custom logo to display in the extension.

The call to `webProofProvider.getWebProof` opens vlayer browser extension and guides the user through the `steps` passed as an argument.

Once we have the Web Proof available we can directly call vlayer client `prove` method, adding the Web Proof to previously created `proverCallCommitment`.

```ts
import { sepolia } from 'viem/chains'
import { proverAbi } from './proverAbi'

const hash = await vlayer.prove({
    ...proverCallCommitment,
    args: [webProof, ...commitmentArgs],
})
```

To learn more details about the Web Proof feature, please see the [Web Proof section](../features/web.md).

### WebSocket proxy

The WebSocket proxy is required in the Web Proofs setup to allow the vlayer extension to access the low-level TLS connection of the HTTPS request for which we are generating a Web Proof (browsers do not provide this access by default). The default WebSocket proxy, `wss://notary.pse.dev/proxy`, used in our SDK and hosted by the TLSN team, supports a limited number of domains (you can view the list [here](https://docs.tlsnotary.org/developers/notary_server.html#websocket-proxy-server)). 

If you'd like to notarize a request for a different domain, you can run your own proxy server. To do this locally run websockify using Docker:

```bash
docker run -p 55688:80 jwnmulder/websockify 80 api.x.com:443
```

Replace `api.x.com` with the domain you'd like to use. Then, configure your Web Proof provider to use your local WebSocket proxy (running on port 55688):

```ts
import { createExtensionWebProofProvider } from '@vlayer/sdk/web_proof'

const webProofProvider = createExtensionWebProofProvider({
  wsProxyUrl: "ws://localhost:55688",
})
```

Now the notarized HTTPS request will be routed through your local proxy server.
