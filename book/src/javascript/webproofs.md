## Web Proofs

On top of access to vlayer JSON-RPC proving API, [vlayer client](./javascript.md) provides functionality to generate and prove [Web Proofs](../features/web.md).

### vlayer browser extension

vlayer provides a browser extension which can be launched (once installed in user's browser) from vlayer SDK and used to generate a Web Proof of a 3rd party website.  
vlayer extension is compatible with Chrome and Brave browsers.

We start by instantiating vlayer client.

```ts
import { createVlayerClient } from '@vlayer/sdk'


const vlayer = createVlayerClient()
```

Next, we can define how the vlayer extension should generate the Web Proof. We do this in a declarative way, by specifying the steps the extension should guide the user through.

```ts
import { 
  createWebProof, 
  startPage, 
  expectUrl, 
  notarize 
} from '@vlayer/sdk/web_proof'

const webProof = createWebProof({
  logoUrl: 'http://twitterswap.com/logo.png',
  steps: [
    startPage('https://x.com/i/flow/login', 'Go to x.com login page'),
    expectUrl('https://x.com/home', 'Log in'),
    notarize('https://api.x.com/1.1/account/settings.json', 'GET', 'Generate Proof of Twitter profile'),
  ],
})
```

The above snippet defines a Web Proof, which is generated by the following `steps`:
1. `startPage` - redirects the user's browser to `https://x.com/i/flow/login`.
2. `expectUrl` - ensures that the user is logged in and visiting `https://x.com/home` URL.
3. `notarize` - prompts the user to generate a Web Proof, i.e. to notarize an HTTP `GET` request sent to `https://api.x.com/1.1/account/settings.json` URL.

Each step also accepts a human-readable message which the user will see. We can also optionally pass a link to custom logo to display in the extension.

Once we have a definition of how a Web Proof should be generated we can request it.

```ts
import { proverAbi } from './proverAbi'
import { sepolia } from 'viem/chains'

const hash = await vlayer.proveWeb({
    address: '0x70997970c51812dc3a010c7d01b50e0d17dc79c8',
    proverAbi,
    functionName: 'proveTwitterProfile',
    args: [webProof, 42, 'eth'],
    chainId: sepolia,
})
```

The above snippet:
* Opens vlayer browser extension and guides the user throught the steps defined above. The Web Proof is generated using vlayer default *Notary* server and WebSocket proxy (the proxy is necessary to give browser access to low-level TLS connection of the HTTPS request we are generating Web Proof for).
* Once the Web Proof is successfully generated, it is submitted to prover contract:
  * with address `0x70997970c51812dc3a010c7d01b50e0d17dc79c8`,
  * whose interface is defined by `proverAbi`,
  * calling `functionName` function of the contract,
  * passing the specified `args` - the generated Web Proof will be passed as first argument in this example,
  * executing the method call on prover contract within the context of `chainId`.

To learn more details about the Web Proof feature, please see the [Web Proof section](../features/web.md).

### Low-level API

While the vlayer client method `proveWeb` described above provides a convenient interface to both the vlayer browser extension and the prover contract, we also provide methods that can access each of them separately.

We can configure a Web Proof provider which uses vlayer browser extension and enables configuring custom *Notary* server and custom WebSocket proxy. 

```ts
import { createExtensionWebProofProvider } from '@vlayer/sdk/web_proof'

const webProofProvider = createExtensionWebProofProvider({
    notaryUrl: 'https://...',
    wsProxyUrl: 'wss://...',
})
```

In the future, vlayer is planning to provide additional Web Proof provider implementations, which can be e.g. ran server-side and don't require vlayer browser extension for the purpose of Web Proof generation.

The Web Proof provider exposes a low-level API to directly define `proverCallCommitment` (commitment to use the generated Web Proof only with the specified prover contract call details, so it's not possible to submit it in a different context) and to explicitly generate the Web Proof by calling `getWebProof`.

```ts
import { 
  startPage, 
  expectUrl, 
  notarize 
} from '@vlayer/sdk/web_proof'

// all args required by prover contract function except webProof itself
const commitmentArgs = ['0x0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045', 123]

const proverCallCommitment = {
  address: '0x70997970c51812dc3a010c7d01b50e0d17dc79c8',
  functionName: 'proveTwitterProfile', 
  commitmentArgs, 
  chainId: sepolia
  proverAbi
}

const webProof = await webProofProvider.getWebProof({
  proverCallCommitment,
  logoUrl: 'http://twitterswap.com/logo.png',
  steps: [
    startPage('https://x.com/i/flow/login', 'Go to x.com login page'),
    expectUrl('https://x.com/home', 'Log in'),
    notarize('https://api.x.com/1.1/account/settings.json', 'GET', 'Generate Proof of Twitter profile'),
  ],
})
```

Once we have the Web Proof available we can directly call vlayer client `prove` method, adding the Web Proof to previously created `proverCallCommitment`.

```ts
import { sepolia } from 'viem/chains'
import { proverAbi } from './proverAbi'

const hash = await vlayer.prove({
    ...proverCallCommitment,
    args: [webProof, ...commitmentArgs],
})
```
