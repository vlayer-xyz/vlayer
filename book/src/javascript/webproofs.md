## Web Proofs

On top of access to vlayer JSON-RPC proving API, [vlayer client](./javascript.md) provides functionality to generate and prove [Web Proofs](../features/web.md).

### vlayer browser extension

vlayer provides a browser extension which can be launched (once installed in user's browser) from vlayer SDK and used to generate a Web Proof of a 3rd party website.

We start by instantiating vlayer client.

```ts
import { createVlayerClient } from '@vlayer/sdk'


const vlayer = createVlayerClient()
```

Next we can define how vlayer extension should generate the Web Proof. We do so in a declarative fashion, by specifying the steps through which the extension guides the user.

```ts
import { 
  createWebProof, 
  redirectStep, 
  requireAuthorization, 
  notarizeStep 
} from '@vlayer/sdk/web_proof'

const logoUrl = 'https://mycompany.com/logo.png'

const webProof = createWebProof({
  steps: [
    redirectStep('https://x.com', 'Go to Twitter', logoUrl),
    requireAuthorization('https://x.com', 'Log in to Twitter', logoUrl),
    notarizeStep('https://api.x.com/1.1/account/settings.json', 'GET', 'Generate Proof of Twitter profile', logoUrl),
  ],
})
```

The above snippet defines a Web Proof, which is generated by the following `steps`:
1. `redirectStep` - redirects the user's browser to `https://x.com`.
2. `requireLogin` - esures that the user is logged in to `https://x.com`.
3. `notarizeStep` - prompts the user to generate a Web Proof, i.e. to notarize an HTTP `GET` request sent to `https://api.x.com/1.1/account/settings.json` URL.

Each step also accepts a human-readable message which the user will see. We can also optionally pass a link to custom logo to display in the extension.

Once we have a definition of how a Web Proof should be generated we can request it.

```ts
import { proverAbi } from './proverAbi'
import { sepolia } from 'viem/chains'

const hash = await vlayer.proveWeb({
    address: '0x70997970c51812dc3a010c7d01b50e0d17dc79c8',
    proverAbi,
    functionName: 'proveTwitterProfile',
    args: [webProof, 42, 'eth'],
    chainId: sepolia,
})
```

The above snippet:
* Opens vlayer browser extension and guides the user throught the steps defined above. The Web Proof is generated using vlayer default *Notary* server and WebSocket proxy.
* Once the Web Proof is successfully generated, it is submitted to prover contract:
  * with address `0x70997970c51812dc3a010c7d01b50e0d17dc79c8`,
  * whose interface is defined by `proverAbi`,
  * calling `functionName` function of the contract,
  * passing the specified `args` - the generated Web Proof will be passed as first argument in this example,
  * executing the method call on prover contract within the context of `chainId`.

To learn more details about the Web Proof feature, please see the [Web Proof section](../features/web.md).

### Low-level API

While vlayer client method `proveWeb` described above provides convenient interface to both vlayer browser extension as well as prover contract, we also provide methods which can access each of them separately.

We can configure a Web Proof provider which uses vlayer browser extension and enables configuring custom *Notary* server and custom WebSocket proxy. 

```ts
import { createExtensionWebProofProvider } from '@vlayer/sdk/web_proof'

const webProofProvider = createExtensionWebProofProvider({
    notaryUrl: 'https://...',
    wsProxyUrl: 'wss://...',
})
```

In the future, vlayer is planning to provide additional Web Proof provider implementations, which can be e.g. ran server-side and don't require vlayer browser extension for the purpose of Web Proof generation.

Web Proof provider exposes a low-level API to directly define `proverCallCommitment` (commitment to use the generated Web Proof only with the specified prover contract call details, such that it's not possible to submit it in a different context) and explicitly generate the WebProof by calling `getWebProof`.

```ts
import { 
  redirectStep, 
  requireAuthorization, 
  notarizeStep 
} from '@vlayer/sdk/web_proof'

// all args to prover contract except webProof itself
const commitmentArgs = ['0x0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045', 123]

const proverCallCommitment = {
  address: '0x70997970c51812dc3a010c7d01b50e0d17dc79c8',
  funcationName: 'proveTwitterProfile', 
  commitmentArgs, 
  chainId: sepolia
  proverAbi
}

const webProof = await webProofProvider.getWebProof({
  proverCallCommitment,
  steps: [
    redirectStep('https://x.com'),
    requireAuthorization('https://x.com'),
    notarizeStep('https://api.x.com/1.1/account/settings.json', 'GET'),
  ],
})
```

Once we have the Web Proof available we can directly call vlayer client `prove` method, adding the Web Proof to previously created `proverCallCommitment`.

```ts
import { sepolia } from 'viem/chains'
import { proverAbi } from './proverAbi'

const hash = await vlayer.prove({
    ...proverCallCommitment,
    args: [webProof, ...commitmentArgs],
})
```
