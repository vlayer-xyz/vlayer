Flow:
1. Go to Twitter website and login
2. Use TLSN plugin to generate TLS proof JSON
    a) find settings.json request
    b) check everything to be visible
    c) mark all text
    d) wait for the notarization
    e) download the proof
3. Exchange the /rust/web_proof/testdata/tls_proof.json file with your downloaded .json file (keep the same name - tls_proof.json)
4. Run script to prepare all services (anvil, vlayer): `source /bash/run-services.sh`
5. Go to /examples/web_proof/vlayer
6. Run `bun run prove.ts`
    -deploys the WebProofProver contract
    -uses prover.ts to call v_call (passing WebProof through calldata) to WebProofProver
    -without actual verification of WebProof running in zkVM
    -checks hardcoded url
7. Response visible in terminal with result 1 - true
