## Workflows

Our workflows fall into the following categories, grouped by a common prefix:

- Build - Verify that the code or artifacts build correctly.
- Lint - Verify that the code passes linting and formatting rules.
- Test - Runs tests, including E2E and post-release tests.
- Performance - Relates to performance stats such us compilation time.
- Release - Produces and uploads artifacts for public.
- Deploy - Deploys artifacts.
