# ⚠️ This Repository is Archived

**This repository contains vlayer v1.0, which is no longer actively maintained.**

We've moved to **vlayer 2.0** - a rebuilt protocol focused on cryptographic proofs for real-world data verification.

## vlayer 2.0

vlayer 2.0 enables developers to extract, verify, and integrate real-world data securely and privately using **Web Proofs (zkTLS)**. Powered by Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC), it provides a foundation for privacy-preserving applications.

### Get Started with vlayer 2.0
