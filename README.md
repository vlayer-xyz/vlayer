# vlayer
vlayer enables developers to extract, verify and integrate real-world data into Ethereum smart contracts. Our technology is powered by Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC), allowing you to securely verify private data without exposing sensitive information. 

Our four core features include: 
- [Web Proofs](https://book.vlayer.xyz/features/web.html): Access verified web data, including APIs and websites, in your smart contracts 
- [Email Proofs](https://book.vlayer.xyz/features/email.html): Tap into email content from your smart contracts and use it on-chain
- [Time Travel](https://book.vlayer.xyz/features/time-travel.html): Leverage historical on-chain data in your smart contracts
- [Teleport](https://book.vlayer.xyz/features/teleport.html): Execute a smart contract across different EVM-comptable blockchain networks
