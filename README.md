# vlayer
vlayer provides tools and infrastructure that give smart contracts super powers like [time travel](https://book.vlayer.xyz/features/time-travel.html) to past blocks, [teleport](https://book.vlayer.xyz/features/teleport.html) to different chains, access to real data from the [web](https://book.vlayer.xyz/features/web.html), and [email](https://book.vlayer.xyz/features/email.html).

vlayer allows smart contracts to be executed [off-chain](https://book.vlayer.xyz//advanced/prover.html). The result of the execution can then be used by [on-chain contracts](https://book.vlayer.xyz/advanced/verifier.html).
